        At a distance of 23 Kms from Mahabalipuram and 35 Kms from Chennai
         (on Chennai - Mahabalipuram Road) Covelong/Kovalam is a famous beach resort and
          one of the popular tourist places to visit near Chennai.

        
        It was originally just a small fishing village, 
        but now also expanded to become one of the most famous beach resorts in South India. 
        You can still explore the old sea port that used to exist there.
         Numerous quality beach resorts can be found at Kovalam. 
         The beaches at that location are absolutely exquisite, and are greatly enjoyed by all that visit there. 
         It is also to these beaches that the well-known Olive Ridley Turtles travel to every year to hatch their eggs
